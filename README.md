## LibreOffice Update Script

Being up to date with software is always a good idea.

The goal of this script is to provide some level of automation for updates because:

- LibreOffice is usually outdated in distribution repositories.
- The Document Foundation does **not** provide an official repository.

The script detects the system language, local and remote versions, and gives you the option to remove and reinstall LibreOffice.

It installs the base, language, and help packages directly from [libreoffice.org](https://www.libreoffice.org).
